# PyTorch Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning materials and implementations while studying PyTorch from the YouTube playlist: [PyTorch Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvboy8bmDCjwNHgTaYH2puK7)

## About Me
- 3rd Year Electrical and Electronics Engineering Student
- Beginner in PyTorch
- Learning Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Course Structure
This repository will be organized according to the course playlist, with each section containing:
- Code implementations
- Notes and explanations
- Practice exercises
- Project work

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
